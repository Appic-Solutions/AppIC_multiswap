# Multiswap Function Explanation

### Step 1: Function Signature and Parameters

```motoko

public func Multiswap(sellingTokens : [Principal], buyingTokens : [Principal], sellAmounts : [Nat], buyAmounts : [Nat], midToken : Principal, midTokenType : Text, sellingTokensType : [Text], buyingTokensType : [Text], caller : Principal)
```

- sellingTokens: An array of principals (addresses) representing the tokens to sell.
- buyingTokens: An array of principals representing the tokens to buy.
- sellAmounts: Corresponding amounts of selling tokens.
- buyAmounts: Corresponding amounts of buying tokens.
- midToken: The principal of the intermediate token used for swaps.
- midTokenType: Type of the intermediate token (e.g., "DIP20", "ICRC1").
- sellingTokensType: Array indicating the type of each selling token.
- buyingTokensType: Array indicating the type of each buying token.
- caller: The principal of the caller initiating the transaction.

### Step 2: Preconditions

```motoko
assert (sellingTokens.size() == sellAmounts.size());
assert (buyingTokens.size() == buyAmounts.size());
```

- These assertions ensure the correct mapping of tokens to their amounts, preventing mismatches in transaction values.

### Step 3: Intermediate Token Actor Initialization

```motoko
let midTokenActor : TokenActorVariable = await _getTokenActorWithType(Principal.toText(midToken), midTokenType);
```

- Retrieves the actor for the intermediate token, which is necessary for further operations like balance checks and token transfers.

### Step 4: Getting Initial Balance of Intermediate Token

```motoko
var midTokenBalInit = 0;
```

- Initialize the variable to store the initial balance of the intermediate token. This is used later to calculate the net change in the intermediate token balance after all swaps.

### Step 5: Selling Loop

```motoko
for (i in Iter.range(0, sellingTokens.size() -1))
```

Iterates through each selling token. Each token undergoes the following steps:

- Token Transfer to Canister: Tokens are transferred to the canister for swapping.
- Approval Checks: Tokens are approved for trade operations depending on their type.
- Token Swap via Sonic: Performs the actual swap operation using a canister called 'sonicCanister'.
- Balance Checks: Checks balance before and after the swap to determine the actual amount of the intermediate token obtained from selling.

### Step 6: Buying Loop

```motoko
for (i in Iter.range(0, buyingTokens.size() -1))
```

- This loop handles the buying of tokens using the intermediate token. Operations similar to the selling loop are performed, but in the context of acquiring new tokens.

### Step 7: Withdrawal of Tokens

- In the final part of the function, the swapped tokens are withdrawn from the 'sonicCanister' and returned to the caller's address.
